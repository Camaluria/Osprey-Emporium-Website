This is the design for this website:

on each page or action request, the action is handled by the Request class.

This way, instead of putting logic on every single page to verify user or admin
is authorized, the logic is handled in one place. 

To that end, I have created template pages that will link that logic to each page.
For all customer pages, i created a customer.php template, which will only need the 
content added to it between the div tags

For all admin  pages, i created a admin.php template, which will only need the 
content added to it between the div tags

for all generic open accessed pages, i created a page.php template, which will only need the 
content added to it between the div tags

this way all the logic will be embedded in the templates

I have also created a header and footer template files in the templates folder. This way,
the header would only need to be updated in one spot for the menu, instead of on many pages
